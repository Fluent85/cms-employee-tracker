# CMS-Employee-Tracker

This is my first attempt at building a Customer Management System with MySQL, node, and inquirer that utilizies a database that I created in MySQL workbench.  I designed the following database schema containing three tables.  Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. 
 

## Motivation

Practice MySQL and learn more about this backend language and also learn how to make functional databases.

## How to use? 

The application will prompt the user to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in a company
So that the user can organize and plan his or her business.


## Issues and future development

Currently the application only works when adding a deparment, role, and employee.  It also works when you view department, role, and employee.  The application also allows the user to update the employee role.  However, I'm still having trouble view the employee with the department name.
